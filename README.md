# Job vacancy parser
A webscraping script which extracts data from timesjobs.com (https://www.timesjobs.com/candidate/job-search.html?searchType=Home_Search&from=submit&asKey=OFF&txtKeywords=&cboPresFuncArea=35) about the jobs posted today. At the beginning you should write skills that you are unfamiliar with, so parser can ignore jobs that require those skills. It updates every 10 minutes after it starts and saves the output in bruh.txt file.
